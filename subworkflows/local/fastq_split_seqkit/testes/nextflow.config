/*
 * WORKAROUND (nf-test + Docker)
 *
 * When running nf-test with Docker, Nextflow may attempt to re-launch
 * `.command.run` directly inside the container (e.g. `.command.run nxf_trace`)
 * without invoking `bash`. Since `.command.run` is not executable by default,
 * this leads to:
 *
 *   /bin/bash: .command.run: Permission denied
 *
 * Making `.command.run` executable resolves the issue.
 *
 * This is a known edge case affecting nf-test / container execution only.
 * It does NOT affect normal pipeline execution.
